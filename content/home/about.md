# Biography

Courtney Gibbons has been at Hamilton College since July, 2013, as an assistant professor of mathematics. She studies commutative and homological algebra, and her primary research interest is the study of infinite free resolutions. She has recently started working in algebraic statistics, too, studying the maximum likelihood degree of models that produce toric varieties.

Daughter of a jazz musician and public school teacher, she grew up near New Haven, CT.  She attended Colorado College, earned a B.A. in mathematics, and worked there for a year after graduation as a paraprofessional. She continued studying math at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln and earned her M.S. and Ph.D. in mathematics. She has supervised a handful of commutative algebra undergraduate research projects at Hamilton and the Willamette Valley Mathematics Consortium REU. In addition to being a multiply-certified math nerd and a reformed college dropout, Professor Gibbons like to rock climb, argue about notation, and snuggle with cats.
