# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We give a complete description of the cone of Betti diagrams over a standard graded hypersurface ring of the form $k [x, y]/\\langle q \\rangle$, where $q$ is a homogeneous quadric. We also provide a finite algorithm for decomposing Betti diagrams, including diagrams of infinite projective dimension, into pure diagrams. Boij–Söderberg theory completely describes the cone of Betti diagrams over a standard graded polynomial ring; our result provides the first example of another graded ring for which the cone of Betti diagrams is entirely understood."
